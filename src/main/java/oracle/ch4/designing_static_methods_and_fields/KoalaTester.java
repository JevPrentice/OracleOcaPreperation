/**
 * In addition to main() methods, static methods have two main purposes: -For
 * utility or helper methods that donâ€™t require any object state. Since there is
 * no need to access instance variables, having static methods eliminates the
 * need for the caller to instantiate the object just to call the method.
 *
 * - For state that is shared by all instances of a class, like a counter. All
 * instances must share the same state. Methods that merely use that state
 * should be static as well.
