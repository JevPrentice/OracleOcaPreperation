/**
 * RULES TO REMEMBER
 * A few of important rules about packages:
 *
 * -> Per Java naming conventions, package names should all be in lowercase.
 * -> The package and sub package names are separated using a dot ( . ).
 * -> Package names follow the rules defined for valid identifiers in Java.
 * -> For packaged classes and interfaces, the package statement is the first statement
 * in a Java source file (a .java file). The exception is that comments can appear
 * before or after a package statement.
 * -> There can be a maximum of one package statement per Java source code file
 * (.java file).
 * -> All the classes and interfaces defined in a Java source code file will be defined in
 * the same package. There is no way to package classes and interfaces defined
 * within the same Java source code file in different packages.
